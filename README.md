# iMessage-Bot-Responder
## How it Works
Uses applescript handler to pick up message text. A response is sent back. 
### Usage:

1. Make sure applescript has privelages over your system. This is just generally good. 
2. Load up iMessage, making sure to select the handler in your settings

(Your screen should appear like this)

3. Text a message, "Baht" [preloaded] to the number to which your computer running this script is connected to. 
4. Watch it run!
